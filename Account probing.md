A user failed to log in to multiple hosts it never accessed before in a short amount of time. This may indicate the account is compromised and an attacker is probing for a host it can access with those credentials.
# Attacker's Goals
Gain access to hosts by using stolen user-account credentials.
# Investigative Actions
Check if the user account was compromised, and which resources it could access.
