# Description
A dormant user logged on to a VPN service after having been unused for a month or longer. This may indicate the account is misused by an attacker.
# Attacker's Goals
Use a compromised user account which has not been used for a long while, and therefore is less likely to be noticed.
# Investigative Actions
Confirm that the activity is benign (e.g. the user returned from a long leave of absence).
See whether there are other abnormal actions done by the user (e.g. files\commands\other logins).
Check if the user initiated other logins aside from a VPN login.
Check whether you have issues with your Cloud Identity Engine failing to sync data from Active Directory.
