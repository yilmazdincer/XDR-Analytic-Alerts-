# Description
This commonly abused host process has been launched by a services.exe parent, indicating it has been installed as a system service. This behavior can have legitimate uses, but often used by malware as a persistence mechanism.
# Attacker's Goals
Attackers may use services to persist or execute commands on remote hosts.
# Investigative Actions
Check whether additional malicious commands were executed from the same process.
Verify if the command-line seems suspicious or contains malicious indicators.
