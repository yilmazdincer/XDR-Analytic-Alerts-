# Description
A dormant user logged on after having been unused for a month or longer. This may indicate the account is misused by an attacker.
# Attacker's Goals
Use a compromised user account which has not been used for a long while, and are therefore less likely to be noticed.
# Investigative Actions
Confirm that the activity is benign (e.g. the user returned from a long leave of absence).
See whether there are other abnormal actions done by the user (e.g. files\commands\other logins).
Check whether you have issues with your Cloud Identity Engine failing to sync data from Active Directory.
