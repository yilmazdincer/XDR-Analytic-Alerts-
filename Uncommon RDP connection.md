# Description
RDP is used by attackers to laterally move to new hosts. Standard processes do not usually implement RDP on their own, and attackers might inject or tunnel using a non-standard process.
# Attacker's Goals
Use an account that was possibly compromised to gain access to the network.
# Investigative Actions
Validate if the process is a legitimate IT software.
Verify if the process is known to be malicious.
Look into actions done on the remote host.
